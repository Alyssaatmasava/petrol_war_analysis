## 📈 Key Findings

### Oil Import Dependency Correlations
- **GDP Impact**: ρ = -0.554 (p = 0.021) - Higher import dependency correlates with worse GDP performance
- **Stock Market Impact**: ρ = -0.411 (p = 0.101) - Similar trend with stock market declines
- **Petrol Price Increases**: ρ = -0.540 (p = 0.057) - Countries with higher import dependency saw larger fuel price hikes

### Strategic Implications
- Energy independence emerges as critical national security priority
- Developing nations face compounded inflation and currency depreciation crises
- Geographic proximity ≠ economic exposure; oil import dependency determines vulnerability

## 📊 Data Sources

- **Kaggle Dataset**: "Global Petrol Prices Impact of 2026 US-Iran War" by zkskhurram
- **Custom Analysis**: Correlation studies and statistical modeling
- **Time Period**: February-March 2026 conflict escalation

## 🧪 Usage

### Running Analysis
```bash
# Execute Jupyter notebooks
jupyter notebook notebooks/oil_crisis_analysis.ipynb
```

### Dashboard Features
- **Crude Oil Trend**: Brent/WTI price evolution with conflict phases
- **Country Fuel Comparison**: Retail price changes across nations
- **War Timeline**: Chronological event mapping with oil impact
- **Economic Impact**: GDP and stock market correlations with oil dependency
